# RebuildingEthanStowell
HTML rebuild assignment
The website I used for this was the following:
http://www.ethanstowellrestaurants.com/
There are still some elements that need adding to this but this is a bisic representation of what the site looks like in HTML. I did use a lot of divs but I tried to specify them because I didnt think they were all Navs or Articles.
